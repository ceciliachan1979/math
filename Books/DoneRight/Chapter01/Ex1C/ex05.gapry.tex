\subsubsection*{Exercise 05 (Gapry)}

\begin{flushleft}
Recall the definition of subspace, \\
\vspace{10px}

A subset $W$ of a vector space $V$ over a field $F$ is called a subspace of $V$
if $W$ is a vector space over $F$ with the operations of addition and scalar
multiplication defined on $V$.
\vspace{10px}

we know that the field of the subspace of the vector space must be equal to 
the same vector space. 
\vspace{10px}

According to the definition 1.22 and the definition of subspace, 
$R^2$ is not the subspace of $C^2$ since they are not the same field.
