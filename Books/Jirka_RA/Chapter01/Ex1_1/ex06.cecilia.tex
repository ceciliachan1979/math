\subsubsection*{Exercise 1.1.6. (Cecilia)}

Define $ a_1 $ to be and arbitrary element of $ A $

Suppose we have already defined $ a_k \in A $, we know that $ a_k $ is not an upper bound of $ A $, therefore there exists some an element $ b $ in $ A $ such that $ b > a_k $, define $ a_{k+1} = b $.

This defines a sequence in $ A $, the sequence contains distinct elements, so it is a countably infinite subset of $ A $.
