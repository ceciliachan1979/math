\subsubsection*{Exercise 1.1.5 (Gapry)}

\begin{flushleft}
If $b$ is an upper bound of the set $\mathbb{A}$, this implies $x \le b$ for all $x \in A$ holds true. 

If $b \in A$ at the same time, then $b$ is the maximum of $\mathbb{A}$.

Since we prove maximum of $\mathbb{A}$ exists and it's $b$, 
we can conclude that $b = \max A = \sup A$. Q.E.D.
