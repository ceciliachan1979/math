\subsection*{Exercise 1.6 (Cecilia)}
No, $D_{24}$ is not isomorphic to the group of rotation of a cube.

We can rotate a cube along the three dimensions for 90 degrees. This yield at least 3 elements of order 4.

But the only two elements in $D_{24}$ having order 4 is rotate by six steps in either direction.

That means they can't be isomorphic.
