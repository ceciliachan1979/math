\subsection*{Lang Exercise 2 (Cecilia)}

As shown in exercise 1, the group is either cyclic (i.e. $Z_4$) or the one show in the multiplication table.

It only remains to show that the multiplication table correspond to $Z_2 \times Z_2$

The map is given by:

\[
\begin{array}{c|c}
\text{Input pair} & \text{Mapped element} \\
\hline
(0,0) & e \\
(1,0) & g \\
(0,1) & h \\
(1,1) & i \\
\end{array}
\]

We can readily check that the mapping is consistent with the multiplication table and therefore the map is the needed isomorphism.
