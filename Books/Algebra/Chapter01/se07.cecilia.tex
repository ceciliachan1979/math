\subsection*{Lang Exercise 7 (Cecilia)}
By Exercise 3.1 of Martin, we know that the group of inner automorphisms cannot be non-trivial cyclic.

But since the group of automorphisms is cyclic, the group of inner automorphisms can only be trivial.

That means every inner automorphism $ x \mapsto g^{-1}xg $ is simply trivial $ x \mapsto x $. In other words, $ g^{-1}xg = x $ for all $ x, g \in G $.

That means $ G $ is Abelian.
