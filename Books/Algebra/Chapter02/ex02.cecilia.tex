\subsection*{Exercise 2.2 (Cecilia)}

We will show that for arbitrary $ a, b \in G $, they commutes.

Consider the set of these three elements $ \{a, b, ab\} $, there is at least one pair of elements will commute.

If the pair $ a, b $ commutes, we are done, there is nothing to prove.

If the pair  $ a, ab $ commutes, then $ aab = aba $, multiplying $ a^{-1} $ on the left hand side will show $ ab = ba $, that is, the pair $ a, b $ commutes as well.

If the pair  $ b, ab $ commutes, then $ bab = abb $, multiplying $ b^{-1} $ on the right hand side will show $ ab = ba $, that is, the pair $ a, b $ commutes as well.

So in all cases, any pair $ a, b $ commutes, so the group must be abelian.
