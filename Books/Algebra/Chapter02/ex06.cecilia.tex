\subsection*{Exercise 2.6 (Cecilia)}

In this case, there are only two cosets. The left cosets are $ \{H , L \}$, the right cosets are $ \{H, R\}$, We can partition $ G $ into $ \{H, G - H\} $, so $ L = G - H = R $. In other words, the left cosets are exactly the right cosets, and therefore $ H $ is normal in $ G $.
