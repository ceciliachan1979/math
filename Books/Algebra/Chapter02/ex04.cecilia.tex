\subsection*{Exercise 2.4 (Cecilia)}
Since $ G $ has two subgroups, it must have an element $ g \ne 1 $.

Consider the subgroup $ \langle g \rangle $, this subgroup cannot be just 1, so it must be $ G $, so $ G $ is cyclic.

Since a cyclic group has a subgroup for each factor of its order, so its order must be prime.
