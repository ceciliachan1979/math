\subsection*{Exercise 3.13 (Cecilia)}
We will prove the required proposition by induction on the group size.

For the base case, the trivial group of size 1 with only the identity element has no prime factor on its group size, the proposition is vacuously true.

For the induction case, consider the group of size $ pq $ where $ p $ is a prime, we will show that there exists an element of order $ p $.

Since the group size $ \ge 2 $, there must be a $ g \ne 1 $. Consider the cyclic group $ C $ generated by $ g $. Let $ c = |C|$.

Suppose $ c $ has a factor of $ p $, then we are done, because $ g^{c/p} $ will be an element of order $ p $.

Otherwise $ c $ does not have a factor of $ p $. Since $ G $ is abelian, $ C $ is a normal subgroup of $ G $ and we can consider the quotient $ Q = G/C $.

$ Q $ has a size of $ pq/c $, which means it has $ p $ as a factor and has size less than $ |G| = pq $. The induction hypothesis applies and now we have an element $ rC \in Q $ with order $ p $.

We have $ (rC)^p = C $, which means $ r^p \in C $.

Any element in $ d \in C $ has the property the $ d^c = 1 $. Now we have $ r^{pc} = 1 $.

Last but not least, $ (r^c)^p = r^{pc} = 1 $, but $ r^c \ne 1 $ because $ \text{gcd}(c, p) = 1 $ and $ r $ has order $ p $, so $ r^c $ is an element of order $ p $.

So in both cases (either the generated cyclic group has a factor of $ p $ or not), we have an element of order $ p $, so by the principle of induction, we have proved the required proposition.
