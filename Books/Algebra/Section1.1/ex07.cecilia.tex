\subsection*{Exercise 1.1.7 (Cecilia)}

Consider the set of sequences such that all elements are integers mod 2. The set can be made into a group by defining the sum of two sequences to be elementwise addition.

The set of all sequences such that all but the first element is zero is a finite subgroup of it.
