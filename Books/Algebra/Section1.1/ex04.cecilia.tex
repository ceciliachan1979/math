Yes, the rules are verified as follow:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item{Closure: The sum of two $ n \times n $ real matrix is always a $ n \times n $ real matrix.}
    \item{Identity: The zero matrix is included in $ M $.}
    \item{Associativity: Follows from matrix addition.}
    \item{Inverse: The matrix $-X$ is the additive inverse for any matrix $X$.}
\end{enumerate}
