\subsection*{Exercise 1.1.6 (Cecilia)}

By the well ordering axiom of the integers, any subgroup $ K $ of $ \mathbb{Z} $ has a least positive integer $ p $.

By group property, $ K $ contains all multiples of $ p $. 

On the other hand, if $ K $ contains a number $ q $ that is not a multiple of $ p $, then $ K $ contains $ q \mod p $ less than $ p $, a contradiction.

So for any subgroup of $ Z $, it must have a least positive integer where all other values in the set is a multiple of it.
