\subsection*{Exercise 6 (Cecilia)}
The theory of Pell's equation gives us infinite solutions for the Diophantine equation $ x^2 - dy^2 = 1 $.

Now for every such solution $ (x + y \sqrt{d})(x - y \sqrt{d}) = x^2 - d^2y = 1 $, therefore $ (x \pm y \sqrt{d}) $ is a unit. In other words, we have infinitely many units.
