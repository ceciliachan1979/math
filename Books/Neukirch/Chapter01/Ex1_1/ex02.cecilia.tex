\subsection*{Exercise 2 (Cecilia)}
$ Z[i] $ is UFD, so we can prime factorize both side.

The right hand side consists of a unit times a pile of factors, each repeated n times.

The left hand side consist of two groups, with some prime power factors comes from $ \alpha $ and some prime powers comes from $ \beta $.

Now, we can do the matching, the key is that one factor belong to exactly one of $ \alpha $ or $ \beta $, and they always get repeated $ n $ times, that is why we can express the answer in the required form.
