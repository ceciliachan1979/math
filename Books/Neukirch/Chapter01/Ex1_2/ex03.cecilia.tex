\subsection*{Exercise 3 (Cecilia)}
Since $ X^2 - Y^3 $ is irreducible and $ Q[X, Y] $ is a UFD, so, $ <X^2 - Y^3> $ is a prime ideal.

Consider the equation $ t^2 - 2t + 1 $ and $ t = \frac{X^2}{Y^3} $, now 
\begin{eqnarray*}
  & & t^2 - 2t + 1 \\
  &=& \frac{X^4}{Y^6} - \frac{2X^2}{Y^3} + 1 \\
  &=& \frac{X^4}{Y^6} - \frac{2X^2Y^3}{Y^6} + \frac{Y^6}{Y^6} \\
  &=& \frac{(X^2 - Y^3)^2}{Y^6}  \\
  &=& 0 \pmod{X^2 - Y^3} 
\end{eqnarray*}
So $ \frac{X^2}{Y^3} \in \fractionfield(\frac{Q[X,Y]}{X^2 - Y^3}) $ is integral over $ Q[X,Y] $. So $ \frac{Q[X,Y]}{X^2 - Y^3} $ is not integrally closed.
\subsubsection{Thought process}
It is rather meaningless to consider linear monic equation, so let's get started with quadratic ones. We want to get
$ \frac{p^2}{q^2} + A\frac{p}{q} + B = 0 $. We are likely going to exploit the fact that it is quotient ring, so we might as well think of the right hand side being a multiple of $ X^2 - Y^3 $

Multiplying $ q^2 $, we get $ p^2 + Apq + Bq^2 = kq^2(X^2 - Y^3) $, at this point it is not hard to come up with the example I gave above.
