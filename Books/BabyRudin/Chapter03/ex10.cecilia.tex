\subsection*{Exercise 10 (Cecilia)}

Suppose on the contrary that the series does have a radius of convergency more than 1, that means $ \limsup\limits_{n \to \infty} \sqrt[n]{|a_n|} = \frac{1}{R} < 1 $.

By theorem 3.17b, there exists $ N $ such that $ \sqrt[n]{|a_n|} < 1 $ for all $ n \ge N $.

There are infinitely many entries in $ a_n $ such that $ a_n $ is a non-zero integer, in that case $ \sqrt[n]{|a_n|} \ge 1 $, but the above implies there can only be finitely many of them.

So there is a contradiction, and that shows the radius of convergency is at most 1.
