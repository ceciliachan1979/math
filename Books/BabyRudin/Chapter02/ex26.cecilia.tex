\subsection*{Exercise 26 (Cecilia)}
Just to clarify the hints:
$ F_n $ is non empty because the finite collection does not cover $ X $.
$ \cap F_n $ is empty because $ \cap F_n $ exclude every $ G $ but $ G $ covers $ X $.

Consider a limit point $ l $, $ l \in X $, so $ l $ is covered by $ G_i $ for some $ i $. Consider a neighborhood $ N_r(l) \subset G_i $, this neighborhood cannot contain any point $ e_j $ where $ j > i $, so such a neighborhood can contain at most a finite number of points, and that contradicts theorem 2.20.
