\subsection*{Exercise 3 (Kelvin)}
We can prove it by contradiction: $\forall{x \in \mathbb{R}}$, x is algebraic.

Let $A$ to be a set of algebraic numbers, if all reals are algebraic, implies $\mathbb{R} \setminus A = \phi$.

However, as $\mathbb{R}$ is uncountable and $A$ is countable from Exercise 2, which means $|\mathbb{R}| > |A|$ and $\mathbb{R} \setminus A \neq \phi$, which leads to contradiction.

Therefore, there exists real numbers which are not algebraic.
