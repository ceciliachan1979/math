\subsection*{Exercise 4 (Kelvin)}
We can prove it by contradiction: irrational real number is countable.

Recall that the real number set $\mathbb{R} = Q \cup Q'$, where $Q$ is a rational number set and $Q'$ is irrational number set.

From the corollary of theorem 2.13, $Q$ is countable, with the assumption of $Q'$ is countable, it can be deduced that $\mathbb{R}$ is countable due to the union of countable set is countable.

However, $\mathbb{R}$ is indeed uncountable, which leads to contradiction.

Therefore, $Q'$ is uncountable.
