\subsection*{Exercise 05 (Gapry)}

\begin{flushleft}
Since $A \subset R$, and $A$ is bounded below, we know that $\inf A$ exists.
Let's claim $\alpha = \inf A$, so that $A = \{x \in R\ |\ x \ge \alpha \}$. 
It follows that $-A = \{-x \in R\ | -x \le -\alpha,\ x \in A\}$. 
Since we know that $\alpha$ is the greatest lower bound, 
the negation of inequality $x \ge \alpha$, which is $-x \le -\alpha$, shows $-\alpha$ the least upper bound, that is , $-\alpha = \sup(-A)$. \\

According to 1.14 Proposition (d), $\alpha = -(-\alpha)$, we can conclude that $\inf A = -\sup(-A)$.
