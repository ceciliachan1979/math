\subsection*{Exercise 08 (Gapry)}
Let $c_1 = i = (0,\ 1)$ are the ordered pair in the complex field $\mathbb{C}$

\begin{enumerate}
    \item{$1 > 0$ (by 1.18d) }
    \item{$-1 < 0$  (by 1.18a applied on (1))}
    \item{$c_1^2 = i^2 = -1 \implies i \neq 0 \implies i^2 > 0 \implies -1 > 0$ (by 1.18d)}
\end{enumerate}

Obviously, 2. and 3. are contradictory.
